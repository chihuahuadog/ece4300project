For YOLO v8:\
clone github repository (I cloned into Desktop), \
run pip install -r requirements.txt \
run python test.py \
Note: you may have to change some of the file paths in test.py since the path files may not be the same\
Or alternatively you could run python test_input.py which allows you to enter file path to photos you want to object detect tank.\
